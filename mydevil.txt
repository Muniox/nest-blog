mydevil.net hosting need: 

in package.json:
"main": "app.js"

in public_nodejs/dist:
app.js

//-------------------------
The root directory of the Node.js project (i.e. the directory where the app.js file is located) 
must be /usr/home/login/domains/domain/public_nodejs. 
You should also delete the index.html file 
with the rm command /usr/home/login/domains/domain/public_nodejs/public/index.html

//-------------------------
Our hosting configuration assumes that the main Node.js application file has the name app.js. 
If that file has a different name then change it to 
app.js and in the package.json file change the value for the "main" key to app.js.
